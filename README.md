# Deep-Learning-CS6910-Assignment 

Instructions to run the files :
1. To generate all the result of the report just run the Assignment_1_Harsh.ipynb file from the start , after changing the wandb key , It will give all the results ,
    similiarly we need to add the key to run the train.py so in File name train.py in line number 34 add the wandb API key of wandb , defaults it is set to my wandb API     key only
2. Now to run train.py just use python train.py -o Optimizer name, similiarly we can pass other parameters, for MSE type "squared_error" not mean squared error .
3. In the line number 35 of train.py change the entity name to user entity(user name of wandb account on which we are currently using) 
   currently it has been saved as harshvrma.
4. If it giving some error please contact me
