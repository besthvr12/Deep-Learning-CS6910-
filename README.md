# Deep-Learning-CS6910-Assignment 
# Instructions to Run the Files

Welcome to the Instructions section! Here, we outline the steps required to generate comprehensive results and run the code files effectively.

## Generating Report Results

To generate the complete report results, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Assignment_1_Harsh.ipynb` file.

2. Run the notebook from start to finish.

3. Before running, don't forget to replace the wandb key with your own key.

Upon completion, the notebook will present a detailed collection of results.

## Running `train.py`

To run the `train.py` script and fine-tune the training process, adhere to these guidelines:

1. Open the `train.py` file.

2. In line number 34, insert your WandB API key. By default, it's set to my WandB API key, but you should replace it with your own.

3. Execute the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python train.py -o OptimizerName
You can pass other parameters as needed. For MSE, use "squared_error" (not "mean squared error").

In line number 35 of train.py, replace the entity name (harshvrma) with your WandB account's user entity.
